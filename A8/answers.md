*Can elaborate on 2. (4-6 sentences), but for 1. 3. 4., 2 sentences maximum*
### 1. how is lane following achieved? (1 points)
- The car follows a list of coordinates given in `data/highway_map.csv`, each of the form $[x,y,s,dx,dy]$. The car uses the distance to each waypoint given by $s$ as well as orientation with respect to the highway loop given by $dx, dy$ to follow the lane. 
### 2. how to use spline to generate a smooth trajectory? (2 point)
- The spline takes in a set of $x,y$ coordinates and fits piecewise polynomial functions with the given $x,y$ coordinates as endpoints. This ensures that the created trajectory intersects all given waypoints and also ensures smooth transitions between each segment of the spline. In our case, cubic spline interpolation is used, meaning a cubic polynomial (which is a smooth function compared to a linear function for example) is fit between the given waypoints, yielding a smooth overall trajectory when pieced together. After this trajectory is created, additional points for the car are sampled from the computed spline-trajectory, making the car's steering transitions smooth. 
### 3. how to avoid collision with the car in front? (0.5 points)
- To avoid a collision with the car in front, we will use the sensor fusion list to determine if the car is in our lane and estimate its distance and speed. This information will help us predict its future position and check if our car is at risk of colliding with it. If the risk is present, we will take immediate action to prevent the collision by either slowing down or changing lanes. This proactive approach ensures our safety on the road and prevents accidents. By continuously monitoring our surroundings and adjusting our driving accordingly, we can avoid potential collisions and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles on the road.
### 4. how to avoid cold start? (0.5 points)
- To avoid the cold start problem, we can incrementally change the reference velocity instead of instantaneously changing it. This method creates a smooth velocity curve and ensures that the acceleration limit condition of $10 m/s^2$ is not exceeded.
### Briefly explain your approach for behaviour planning and any modifications to the provided trajectory generation code (7-10 sentences) (2 points)
- Instead of just considering the current lane, my approach includes determining which lanes are free for a lane switch. This ensures the vehicle has a clear path when changing lanes, reducing the risk of collision. Additionally, we ensure that there is sufficient clearance between cars in front and behind the ego vehicle in the target lane when attempting a lane switch to avoid any potential accidents.
- To prevent sudden lane changes and ensure smooth transitions, my approach includes the implementation of a cooldown threshold after each lane change. This cooldown insists that a certain amount of time passes, typically a couple of seconds, before another lane switch is accepted. My behaviour planning approach also considers the speed limit of the road, and we ensure that the vehicle adheres to the speed limit when changing lanes.
- Furthermore, my approach includes evaluating the surrounding traffic before executing any manoeuvres. We use data from the sensor fusion list to determine the position, speed, and behaviour of other vehicles on the road. This information enables the autonomous vehicle to make informed decisions that prioritize safety and avoid any potential accidents.
